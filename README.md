Code repo for [create-machine-learn-models](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/create-machine-learn-models/), the **Data Science** Learning Path on Microsoft Learn. This course is based on The University of California, Berkeley - Computational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data Science textbook http://www.inferentialthinking.com
The learning Path only constitutes of code snippets, so here you find code you can run and get the output as indicated. refer to the Jupyter notebook.

### 4 March 2023 update:

Start by importing ```urllib3``` library, a powerful, user-friendly HTTP client for Python.

To make use of ```urllib3``` library, make sure you pip install using the following shell commands

```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
python -m pip install urllib3
```
Once ```urllib3``` is installed the ```import urllib3``` should excute without errors.

### Running python code in Jupyter notebook vs Python scripts on commandline

[Version 1.76 of visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_76) comes with Interactive Window, so for people who are not familiar with working with Jupyter notebooks, they can simply run the python files in visual studio code or straight from command line using the following shell command: ```python ReadNewOnlineBook.py ```
